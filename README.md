# weather-app
Basic weather app that utilizes API calls. Skills utilized:

- Javascript
    - Asynchronous functions & Promises
    - API data fetch
- CSS
- Webpack

Note: The CSS/formatting is far from complete, but my primary focus was to get more comfortable working with asynchronous functions and API's. If I revisit this project in the future, I will plan to make the UI more visually pleasing, add units where needed, and allow users to switch between Farenheit and Celsius for temperatures.
